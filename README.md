## Inspiration
Ubon Ratchathani is one of the provinces that faces flooding almost every year during the rainy season. This flooding not only damages their properties but also takes a toll on people's mental well-being of the people in the area. So, when TGR2023 announced a challenge, our team focused on detecting and alerting water levels from all three main rivers in Ubon Ratchathani. We also collected data on how fast the water was flowing and monitored the status of reservoirs and dams nearby. This data would have helped us to alert the public and relevant authorities to manage and mitigate the damage caused by flooding.

## Breaking down the problem
The primary challenge is prediction methods of water levels in specific areas by using data from the Mekong, Mun, and Chi rivers. Our aim is to create a system capable of predicting water levels, displaying real-time water level data and issuing alerts in the event of fluctuations. 

In this competition, we had only 5 days to complete our challenge, so we divided our team into three different teams: Hardware, Software, and Network. Each team had its own target to develop a module for use in solving the problem. Then, we integrated each module together to make the device work as intended.
